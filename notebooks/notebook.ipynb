Currently, the retailer sells over 4000 unique products. To take inventory of the items, your manager has asked you whether you can group the products into a small number of categories. The categories should be similar in terms of price and quantity sold and any other characteristics you can extract from the data.\n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"5a0a52d9","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
